       <li><p align="justify">Added the folder Supersampling which contains an script that supersamples an image, and some input and output image examples;</p></li>
       <li><p align="justify">Added the folder Images. Each folder contained in the folder Images contains images of three different games. The images which name start with "Output" were generated by our code. The other ones were generated by a native image processing tool in the games.</p></li>

<p align="justify">Abstract: Anti-aliasing consists in a techique designed to add greater realism to a digital image by smoothing jagged edges on curved lines and diagonals. It is largely used in games, digital photography and computer graphics. The objective of this project is to implement and compare different anti-aliasing algorithms regarding their effectiveness.</p>
