Precisamos falar:
	-> The main image processing tasks involved (such as: image restoration,
	   image segmentation, image description, etc.)
	   
	-> Examples of images that are going to be the input for the intended
	   application
	   
	-> The main objective
	
	-> The description of input images (with examples) including the source
	   of the images (website, paper, acquired by the student(s))
	   
	-> Description of steps to reach the objective, including the methods
	   that are intended to be used (e.g., image enhancement, edge-detection,
	   morphology, segmentation, texture analysis, color analysis, keypoint
	   detection etc.)
	   
	-> Supersampling
	   
It should also present some initial code with the first results obtained
analysing the images.

-> Include an update at the git repository, in particular in the README files
